## 🔧 Working Principle
1. **Thermistor** detects a rise in temperature (resistance decreases).  
2. **Transistor (BC547)** switches ON when triggered by voltage change.  
3. **555 Timer IC** operates in **astable mode**, generating a square wave.  
4. **Buzzer** produces a continuous sound as a fire alert.  
5. **Variable Resistor (VR1)** adjusts the sensitivity (temperature threshold).  
6. **7805 Voltage Regulator** provides a stable +5V supply from a 9V battery.
